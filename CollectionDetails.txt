#1:What is Collections Framework?
	-We will use Collectings Framework
		For Storing Objects in differnets formats and orders without Size and
		type limitation and further.
	-Carrying all objects at a time one class method to another class method 
	across multiple layers of the project as method argument and return type
	with single name.
	-We will use collections framework.
	
#2:What is a collection?
	-In general A group of individual things is called collection
 	-Technally
 		A collection is a container object, it is used for collecting multiple
 		homogenous and heterogenous,unique and duplicate individuals objects without
 		size limitation and further it is used for sending all these objects
 		as one unit using single name from one class method to another class
 		method as argument and return value.
 		
 		Example:1.School Bag		->Heterogenous Collection
 				2:Container Lorry	->Homogenous Collection	
 #3:What are the Different operations we can perform on collection object?
 	-We can perform 9 operations on collection object
 		1.adding 	object
 		2.counting 	objects	
 		3.printing 	object
 		
 		4.Searching object
 		5.Retrieving object
 		6.Removing 	object
 		
 		7.replacing  object
 		8.inserting  object
 		9.sorting    objects	
 
 #4:How can we store multiple objects as one group?
 	1.By using an Array
 	2.by using collection
 	
 #5:Why do we need collection when we have array already?
 						or
 	What are the problems of array those forcing sun to develop collection API?
 						or
 	Why Sun developed collection API, when we have array for collecting
 	objects?					
 						or
 	What are the problems of array?
 		->Array has five problems
 			1.It allows only homogenous objects
 			2.Its Size canot be increased or decreased.
 			3.Does not have in-built methods to perform different operations
 			 such as removing,searching,sorting,etc..
 			4.Cannot store objects in different formats
 			5.Cannot store objects in different order
 		
 		:To solve all above five problems of array object SUN developed 
 		 collections API.	  							
 						
 	1.It allows only homogenous objects
 		-Object[] obj=new Object[5];
 		
 		obj[0]=new Faculty();	
 		obj[1]=new Student();	
 		obj[2]=new Lion();	
 		obj[3]=new Cat();	
 		obj[4]=new Bike();
 							
 		obj[5]=new Car(); :Error(max size)	
 	Object[] tempObj=new Object[10];
 	
 	for(int i=0;i<obj.length;i++){
 		tempObj[i]=obj[i];
 	}	
 	obj=tempObj;
 	obj[5]="car";				
 						
 	2.Its Size canot be increased or decreased.					
 		->Algorithim for Solving problem:
 			1.Create a class with Object[] object with required capacity
 			2.Develop a method to store elements in this array
 			3.Before storing every element we must check size
 			  reached to collection capacity or not
 			4.if Reached,we must increase capacity as below
 				a.Create new array with more required capacity
 				b.Copy elements from old array to this new array
 				c.Assign this new array object reference to old array
 				referenced variable
 			5.Then store new element at end of all elements in this new 
 			  array object.
